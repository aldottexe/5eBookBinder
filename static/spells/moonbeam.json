{"title": "Moonbeam", "book": "Player's Handbook", "level": "2", "casting time": "1 action", "range": "120 feet", "componenents": "V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)", "duration": "Concentration, up to 1 minute", "description": "<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p>\n<p>When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can\u2019t assume a different form until it leaves the spell\u2019s light.</p>\n<p>On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.</p>"}
