{"title": "Fabricate", "book": "Player's Handbook", "level": "4", "casting time": "10 minutes", "range": "120 feet", "componenents": "V, S", "duration": "Instantaneous", "description": "<p>You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.</p>\n<p>Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the raw materials.</p>\n<p>Creatures or magic items can\u2019t be created or transmuted by this spell. You also can\u2019t use it to create items that ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan\u2019s tools used to craft such objects.</p>"}
