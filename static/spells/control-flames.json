You affect it in one of the following ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>You cause simple shapes\u2014such as the vague form of a creature, an inanimate object, or a location\u2014to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of its non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action.</p>"}
