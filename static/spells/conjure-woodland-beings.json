Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 6th-level slot, and three times as many with an 8th-level slot.</p>"}
