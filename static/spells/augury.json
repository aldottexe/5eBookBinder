The DM chooses from the following possible omens:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weal, for good results</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Woe, for bad results</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Weal and woe, for both good and bad results</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Nothing, for results that aren\u2019t especially good or bad</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>"}
