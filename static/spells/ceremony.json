When you cast the spell, choose one of the following ceremonies, the target of which must be within 10 feet of you throughout the casting.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Atonement.</em></strong> You touch one willing creature whose alignment has changed, and you make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check. On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Bless Water.</em></strong> You touch one vial of water and cause it to become holy water.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Coming of Age.</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Dedication.</em></strong> You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god\u2019s service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Funeral Rite.</em></strong> You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can\u2019t become undead by any means short of a <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:wish\">Wish</a> spell.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Investiture (UA).</em></strong> You touch one willing humanoid. Choose one 1st-level <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells\">spell</a> you have prepared and expend a spell slot and any material components as if you were casting that spell. The spell has no effect. Instead, the target can cast this spell once without having to expend a spell slot or use material components. If the target doesn\u2019t cast the spell within 1 hour, the invested spell is lost.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Wedding.</em></strong> You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed.</p>"}
