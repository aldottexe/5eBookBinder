{"title": "Contact Other Plane", "book": "Player's Handbook", "level": "5", "casting time": "1 minute", "range": "Self", "componenents": "V", "duration": "1 minute", "description": "<p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u2019t take actions, can\u2019t understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speak only in gibberish. A <a href=\"http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:greater-restoration\">Greater Restoration</a> spell cast on you ends this effect.</p>\n<p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as &quot;yes,&quot; &quot;no,&quot; &quot;maybe,&quot; &quot;never,&quot; &quot;irrelevant,&quot; or &quot;unclear&quot; (if the entity doesn\u2019t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>"}
