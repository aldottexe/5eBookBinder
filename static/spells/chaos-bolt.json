Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>d8</th>\n<th>Damage Type</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Acid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Cold</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Fire</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Force</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Lightning</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>Psychic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>Thunder</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<p>If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.
