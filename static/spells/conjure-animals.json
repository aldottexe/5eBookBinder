Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures\u2019 statistics.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.</p>"}
