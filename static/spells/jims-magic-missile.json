Each dart can target a creature of your choice that you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack for each missile. On a hit, the missile does 2d4 force damage.</p>\n<p>If the attack roll scores a critical, the missile does 5d4 force damage instead of the 4d4 force that you would normally get on a critical.
