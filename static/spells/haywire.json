Each electronic device in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range is subject to random behavior while it remains within the area. A device not held by a creature is automatically affected. If an electronic device is held by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the device affected by the spell.</p>\n<p>At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6 for each affected device to determine its behavior. Except where otherwise indicated, that behavior lasts until the start of your next turn while this spell is in effect.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>d6</th>\n<th>Effect</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>The device shuts down and must be restarted.
