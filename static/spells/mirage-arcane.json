{"title": "Mirage Arcane", "book": "Player's Handbook", "level": "7", "casting time": "10 minutes", "range": "Sight", "componenents": "V, S", "duration": "10 days", "description": "<p>You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain\u2019s general shape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road.</p>\n<p>Similarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn\u2019t disguise, conceal, or add creatures.</p>\n<p>The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell\u2019s area disappears immediately.</p>\n<p>Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the terrain\u2019s true form;&nbsp;however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion\u2019s presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion.</p>"}
