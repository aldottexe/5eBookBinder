The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.</p>\n<p>You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn\u2019t have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.</p>"}
