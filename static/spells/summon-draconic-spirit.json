It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Draconic Spirit stat block.

The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>\n<p>The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell\u2019s level appears in the stat block.</p>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th colspan=\"6\">Draconic Spirit</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><em>Large Dragon, Neutral</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Armor Class</strong> 14 + the level of the spell (natural armor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Hit Points</strong> 50 + 10 for each spell level above 5th (the dragon has a number of hit dice [d10s] equal to the level of the spell)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Speed</strong> 30 ft., fly 60 ft., swim 30 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>STR</th>\n<th>DEX</th>\n<th>CON</th>\n<th>INT</th>\n<th>WIS</th>\n<th>CHA</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19 (+4)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>17 (+3)</td>\n<td>10 (+0)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Resistances(Chromatic and Metallic Only)</strong> acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Resistances(Gem Only)</strong> force, necrotic, psychic, radiant, thunder</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Condition Immunities</strong> charmed, frightened, poisoned</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Senses</strong> blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Languages</strong> Draconic, understands the languages you speak</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Challenge</strong> \u2014 <strong>Proficiency Bonus (PB)</strong> equals your bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Shared Resistances.</strong> When you summon the dragon, choose one of its damage resistances.
