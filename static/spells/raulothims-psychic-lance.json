Alternatively, you can utter a creature\u2019s name. If the named target is within range, it becomes the spell\u2019s target even if you can\u2019t see it. If the named target isn\u2019t within range, the lance dissipates without effect.</p>\n<p>The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 7d6 psychic damage and is incapacitated until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t incapacitated.</p>\n<p><strong><em>At Higher Levels.</em></strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.</p>"}
