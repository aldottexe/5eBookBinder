When you cast the spell, and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your senses on one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. You instantly learn the target\u2019s prevailing emotion, whether it\u2019s love, anger, pain, fear, calm, or something else. If the target isn\u2019t actually humanoid or it is immune to being charmed, you sense that it is calm.</p>"}
