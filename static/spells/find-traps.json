Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.</p>\n<p>This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don\u2019t learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>"}
