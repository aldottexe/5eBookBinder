{"title": "Wall of Force", "book": "Player's Handbook", "level": "5", "casting time": "1 action", "range": "120 feet", "componenents": "V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)", "duration": "Concentration, up to 10 minutes", "description": "<p>An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within range.<br />\nThe wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).</p>\n<p>Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by <em><a href=\"/spell:dispel-magic\">dispel magic</a></em>. A <em><a href=\"/spell:disintegrate\">disintegrate</a></em> spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.</p>"}
