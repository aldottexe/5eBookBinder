You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for each question.</p>\n<p>Divine beings aren\u2019t necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \u201cunclear\u201d as an answer if a question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity\u2019s knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity\u2019s interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.</p>\n<p>If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>"}
